# IMTreatment


This module has been written to carry out analysis and more specifically structure detection on PIV velocity fields.
It is now more general and can handle different kind of data (point cloud, scalar and vector field, ...) and perform classical and more advanced analysis on them (spectra, pod, post-processing, visualization, ...).

More details are available at [IMTreatment](https://framagit.org/gabylaunay/IMTreatment/).
